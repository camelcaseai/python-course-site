## 1.4 Running Python Code

You can run Python in a few ways:

| Method             | Use Case                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **REPL (terminal)**| Try out quick commands: `python` or `python3` |
| **Script files**   | Save code in `.py` files and run via `python filename.py` |
| **Jupyter Notebook**| Interactive learning and visualization        |
